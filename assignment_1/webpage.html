    <ol>
        <li>This is a list item.</li>
        <li>You use them for listacles</li>
        <li>Like Buzzfeed</li>
        <li>(Is Buzzfeed still a thing?)</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>This is an unordered list</li>
        <li>Like when you're writing a list for groceries</li>
    </ul>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            These kinds of lists are called 'description lists'. They have different forms. This form called 'dt', or 'define terms'
        </dt>
        <dd>And this is the 'description details' element where you can put tags and paragraphs and many other things.</dd>
