Websites that I dislike:

https://twitter.com/home

- It has a similar side panel to that of many social media, but it prioritizes suggested accounts and posts over the accounts you actually follow. Having the post button displayed at the bottom of the screen makes it appear as though the website's not intended for posting, as well.

- The pictures for the clothes are insanely large for the screen. It makes scrolling through their items a chore and I feel like a more uniform layout would be so much better for customers to comb through. Also, their filters for finding specific pieces (like, for example, a certain style of denim) is nonexistent or very basic with only size and color. 

https://www.nintendo.com/us/

- I feel like there's so much going on. They have a bunch of different things like new games, featured items, the Nintendo store, and so many other things all on the main page of the site. It's overwhelming to look at.

Websites that I like:

https://www.youtube.com/

- I like the desktop design a lot with the side panel for the more important sections like the channels you subscribe to, your own playlists, etc and it's separate from the main focus which is the list of videos ready to be watched. It's overall pretty organized and straight to the point.

https://www.proquest.com/

- The first thing you see is the search bar, which is great as people are coming to the website to find materials for their research. It's very easy to navigate and the layout is just really nice to look at.
